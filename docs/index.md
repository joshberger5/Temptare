# Temptare
## Description
Gun safety is a pressing issue in the United States at the moment. According to Megan L. Ranney et al., "firearm injury and death are a major public health problem, with more than 40,000 deaths and an estimated 85,000-130,000" [^1]. Additionally, there are approximately 20 instances in which hunters accidentally shoot a human instead of a deer each year in the United States [^2]. Therefore, something needs to be done to reduce the number of people harmed or killed by guns each year. Educating people on where to point the gun and when to pull the trigger could be a possible solution. That's why I made Temptare[^3], my attempt at game development. Temptare is a virtual reality video game intended to replicate Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II's Training Course mixed with elements of the Men in Black: Alien Attack ride at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida.
