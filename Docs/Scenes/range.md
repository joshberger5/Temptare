# Range Scene

![](../SceneImages/Range.png)

This scene is made to teach the user the controls and rules of the game. The user again has the ability to pick up the two [blasters](../prefabs.html#blaster) in front of them. Shooting the [red blocks (hostile targets)](../prefabs.html#target) will increase the score located above the user's head. Shooting the [green blocks (friendly targets)](../prefabs.html#freindly) will display a [message warning](../prefabs.html#warningcanvas) the user not to shoot friendly targets. If the user turns around, there is a hyperlink, which takes the user back to the [Main Menu](./Scenes/mainMenu.html).
