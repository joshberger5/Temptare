# TEMPTARE[^1]
## Description
**Gun safety** is a pressing issue in the United States at the moment. According to Megan L. Ranney et al., "firearm injury and death are a major public health problem, with more than **40,000 deaths and an estimated 85,000-130,000 injuries a year**"[^2]. Additionally, there are approximately 20 instances in which hunters accidentally shoot a human instead of a deer each year in the United States[^3]. Therefore, something needs to be done to reduce the number of people harmed or killed by guns each year. Educating people on where to point the gun and when to pull the trigger could be a possible solution. That's why I made Temptare. Temptare is a **Virtual Reality** video game intended to replicate Call of Duty: **Modern Warfare II**'s Training Course mixed with elements from the **Men in Black: Alien Attack** ride at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. I chose Virtual Reality as the medium for Temptare, because Virtual Reality has the potential to increase the user's learner enjoyment (motivation)[^4] and immersion[^5] over traditional learning techniques. Additionally, Virtual Reality can be an effective means of eliminating risks, because it takes guns out of beginners hands and operates in a safe, controlled environment[^6].
